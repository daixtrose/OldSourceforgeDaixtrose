\label{sec: Code Organization}


The code of \Daixtrose is organized as follows:

All sourcecode is located in the directory \somecode{src}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item directory \somecode{daixtrose} constains the core Expression Template library 
\item directory \somecode{tiny} contains the fixed sized matrix and vector
  library built on top of the \Daixtrose core library
\item directory \somecode{linalg} contains a linear algebra library mainly
  consisting of an STL-based sparse matrix implementation with
  compatible vector classes.
\item directory \somecode{demos} contains smaller examples which give an idea
  about the features offered by the already mentioned parts of the library.
\end{itemize}
