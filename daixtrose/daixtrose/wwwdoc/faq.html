<LI> What is Daixtrose?

<li>
<p> <b>Daixtrose </b>is a C++ header library framework
that serves as a generic disambiguated expression template (ET) core engine.
It was designed to help You to build Your own expression template library at home.

In addition to that Daixtrose comes with a full featured sparse and fixed sized
matrix/vector library which serves as a demo for the power of the new approach
and which can be used without worrying about all the gory details of ET
programming.

<UL>
<LI> Who invented that name and why is it spelled the wrong way?

<p> There was a time this lib was called <B>Diet</B> (Differentiable Improved
Expression Templates), but most mail correspondence about it was swallowed by
spam filters like exim. So a long search for a new, yet unique name started.
Finally Markus Werle started a mail-based contest to obtain a new name for the
game.  

<p>
Alexander Voss and Arne Barinka proposed to call it <B>Dextrose</B> and
to probably replace "ex" with "aix" to underline the fact that this library was
invented at Aachen, Germany, which is called "Aix la Chapelle" by native French
speakers.  (To those who never heard about Aachen: it's a small unimportant town
with an important <a href="http://www.rwth-aachen.de/">University of
Technology</a>)

<p>
Since people from dextrose.com disliked the reuse of "dextrose", Arne's and Alex'
proposal was accepted. 

<p>
Special thanks go to Arne and Alex for finding a unique name (search google)
at the beginning of the 21st century, a few days before all names belonged to someone.

<UL>
<LI> Are there any requirements for the C++ compiler?

<p> Yes. You really need a standard conformant compiler. Something like Intel's icpc-7.0 (EDG frontend) or gcc-3.4 is appropriate. 
</UL>


<p><br>

<UL>
<LI> Ist there a port of <b>Daixtrose</b> to compiler foo?  <p> Well,
<b>Daixtrose</b> seeks portability through standard conformance, not by crappy
constructs for compilers from companies that did not try hard enough to follow
standards. Take a look at the source code and find that it is awkward enough
without any #ifdef inside. If You find a piece of code that can be made a little
bit more portable by just adding some delimiters or so, feel free to contribute
this information via <a
href="mailto:daixtrose-port@lists.sourceforge.net">daixtrose-port@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.

<p>
Also, if You feel like there must be a port to a certain compiler
and You take the task, Your contribution to this library is welcome.
You are encouraged to use the above-mentioned mailing list.
