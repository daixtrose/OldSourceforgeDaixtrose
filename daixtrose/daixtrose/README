         "Differentiable EXpression Templates - the Reusable Open Source Engine"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daixtrose is a C++ header library framework that serves as a generic disambiguated
expression template (ET) core engine.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

Further Description:

Daixtrose provides a framework which makes the use of ET techniques both easy and
maintainable by using a structure-functionality-separation model. A minimum of
restrictions is placed upon the classes used together with the ET framework: it
is possible to "plug" existing C++ types into the ET engine without the need of
changing any line of code inside the declarations of these (exception: users who
wish assignment from expressions to work, have to supply an appropriate
asignment operator or some other publicly available setting mechanism)
 

Features:

* compile-time analytic differentiation of expressions

* compile-time expression manipulation a la simplify (yet rudimentary but easily
  extensible)

* maintenance ease due to the underlying separation-model: orthogonal concepts 
  stay separated from each other.

* A new user-definable and user-extensible disambiguation mechanism allows for
  fine-grained control of compile-time errors for accidentical use on 
  incompatible types while supporting the possibility for user defined 
  workarounds in the incompatibility case.
 

Additional Features:

Daixtrose comes with a few small explanatory examples like e.g. a TinyMatrix and
a simple std::vector/std::map based sparse-matrix implementation (see directory
linlag) which show the most important features. Documentation is under permanent
construction, but yet not available due to some open issues which may affect the
kernel of the library.
 

Lincense Issues: 

Daixtrose is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
Daixtrose is intended to be used by everyone. Though Daixtrose is published
under the LGPL it is planned to change the license to something less restrictive
_if_ the drawbacks of the LGPL, as recently discussed at www.boost.org, really
inhibit the broad use of this library for commercial projects. The decision
about the final license model is postponed until boost developers took the
decision about their own license or if the author obtains more clarity about
this issue (You may help in this really nasty and political decision)

In the meantime the license has an additional passage added to every source code
file, which allows commercial programs to use the template code without getting
into the "illegal zone":

   "As a special exception, you may use this file as part of a free software
   library without restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate
   templates or use macros or inline functions from this file, or you compile
   this file and link it with other files to produce an executable, this
   file does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by
   the GNU Lesser General Public License.  This exception does not however
   invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
   the GNU Lesser General Public License."
