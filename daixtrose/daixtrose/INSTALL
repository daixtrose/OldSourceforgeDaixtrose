Installation instructions:

System requirements
-------------------

- A modern high performance ANSI compliant C++ compiler.  

  This is the strongest requirement of all, since this library exploits all the
  bright and dark corners of C++. At present only Intel's C++ version 7.0 with
  option -ansi is known to compile this code. GNU gcc-3.4 will be able to
  compile this soon, since it only suffers from a parser bug in using
  declarations, but otherwise performs well on this code.

  The author appreciates success reports with other compilers

- loki-lib (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib/)
- boost    (see http://www.boost.org/)


Usage
-----

This library is completely header-based.  So You may use the headers directly
and a simple #include "SomeHeader.h" will do. The most important one is
"daixtrose/Daixt.h" which includes all of the core engine. But
of course You may #include the files in a more refined way.

In order to use the tiny matrix and vector, You have to 
#include "tiny/TinyMatAndVec.h". 
For the linalg package (sparse matrix + vector) one needs to 
#include "linalg/Linalg.h"


System wide installation and testsuite
--------------------------------------

To ease the compilation of the testsuite, to support multiple different
installations and to support possible future diversification of the library,
daixtrose is shipped with a GNU autotool-based configure shell script.

Perform the following steps (or modifications), if You like to get the examples built:

(It is recommened to create a new directory _outside_ of this directory,
to keep the original source tree clean)

$ cd ..
$ mkdir build-daixtrose
$ cd build-daixtrose
$ ../daixtrose-0.0.1/configure \
CXX=icpc CPPFLAGS="-g -wd76 -ansi -O3  -Ob2" --prefix=$HOME/daixtrose-0.0.1-beta \
--with-loki=/path/to/loki/prefix --with-boost=/path/to/boost/prefix

$ make 
$ make check
$ make install


Update of the library
---------------------

At present this lib undergoes permanent evolution. So it is a good idea to use
the cvs repository to keep track of the rapid changes.
The following commands are sufficient to check out the latest version:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/daixtrose login 
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/daixtrose co modulename 

You may also take a look at the cvs web-interface under
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=75079


Please stay patient until the docs are finished. Take a look at the directories
demos, tiny and linalg to get an idea how to use this library.


Have a lot of fun!
