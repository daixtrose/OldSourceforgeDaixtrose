Installation instructions:

This library is completely header-based. No lib has to be compiled or installed.
So just use the headers. The most important one is "daixtrose/Daixtrose.h" which
includes practically all of the core engine. But of course You may #include the
files in a more intelligent way.

If You like to use the tiny matrix and vector, You have to include
"tiny/TinyMatAndVec.h".

Please stay patient until the docs are finished. This lib is still in prerelease
stage.
